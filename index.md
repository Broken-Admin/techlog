Hi, I'm Broken-Admin. 

I enjoy programming, tinkering with hardware, astronomy, various physics fields, mathematics, and other topics relating to those.
Although I also entertain myself with lingusitics, writing and numeral systems, history, and other general purpose topics.

A catalog of the articles I've written can be found [here](/techlog/catalog).
