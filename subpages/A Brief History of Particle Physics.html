    <p>To preface, this article targets the more advanced audience.</p>
    <div class="readable">
        <p>Particle physics was once a dominating force for the explanation of the universe and its properties. Over time theoretical physics pushed it to limits in the furthering of scientific knowledge, being ushered to the side by superstring theory. To further research, the search for the elementary and indivisible must first take note of the past and origins.</p>
        <p>To introduce particle physics it is best to start at elementary particles, which are thought to be indivisible, the final and most finite part of matter. These constituents of matter are currently referred to as fermions by the standard model, these fermions are described to undergo three of the four fundamental interactions which mediate electronic charge, magnetic fields, radioactive decay, and the bonding of protons and neutrons into the atomic nucleus - all by the exchange of gauge bosons. The fourth of the interactions - gravity - is described by the separate general theory of relativity, and in the standard model it is supposed to be mediated by the theoretical graviton. Posing the need for a new theory or adjustments to currently accepted theory, allowing a description of all fundamental interactions together.</p>
        <p>At the origin, particle physics can be said to have its farthest origin in Greek philosophers. Democritus is thought of as the origin of the modern-day study of the elementary and indivisible, alongside others. Democritus was considered a more frequent writer and father of the elementary. Although there had been contrasting views, such as the Platonic geometries. For the time of Democritus, atomism did not become commonplace and was not revived until the later point of the 17th century.</p>
        <p>Those accredited with the rebirth of atomism and the elementary are Ren√© Descartes, Robert Boyle, and Pierre Gassendi. Francis Bacon and Galileo Galilei. Although, with the future discovery of the electron and nucleus, it was found that atomism could not thus explain all when atoms did not truly seem to be indivisible.</p>
        <p>Between 1879 and 1897 the works of Arthur Schuster, J. J. Thomson, and William Crookes furthered the discovery of the electron, proving that the atom is not indivisible. Ernest Rutherford helped model and discover the interior of the atomic structure, establishing that the atomic structure consisted of a nucleus of positive charge surrounded by electrons.</p>
        <p>In the current age and the recent past, humanity has witnessed the development of the height of scientific thinking. We witnessed the creation of the standard model of particle physics, introducing fermions, specifically quarks, and the carriers of force, the gauge bosons. We witnessed the theory of general relativity come to describe the large and fast. We witnessed the theory of quantum mechanics and how its discoveries allowed for a further explanation of matter and its behavior at the smallest levels. Despite this, there has been no success in merging these theories and models.</p>
        <p>We must learn from the past, to once again uphold the style of thought in which all was considered and none was left uncovered because of scientific or religious dogma. We must learn from our history, only then may we march into the next age of the modern idea of the elementary and indivisible holding a completed theory of everything, then leading ourselves into the next scientific revolution.</p>
