    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">Data structures</a> define the way primitive data is stored, such as numbers or character. There are many different types of data structures.</p>
    <p>A commonly used data structure is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure">array</a>, which consists of a primitive data types which are stored consecutively in memory.</p>
    <p>Typically using an index with an array allows one to access specifc items with a <cde>O(1)</cde> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Constant_time">time complexity.</a>.</p>
    <p>A popular use for arrays are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string">null-terminated strings</a>. Which consist characters "strung" together in an array, terminated by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character">null character</a>.</p>
    <p>Another different but similar data structure is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked list</a>. A linked list has values which are not stored end-to-end in memory, but which contain the location of the next - and sometimes previous - node in the list alongside their own value or values.</p>
    <p>In a linked list, the <code>n</code>th node can be accessed with an O(n) time complexity.</p>
    <p>Although lists are common ways to store data, there are also many other ways in which it can be stored.</p>
    <p>Stacks are an older but still used data structure. They consist of a top and bottom, in which the top grows away from the bottom as data is stored.</p>
    <p>A stack almost always has 2 operations which can be performed on it, <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>push</code> operation puts an item on the "top" of the stack, moving the top away from the bottom. A <code>pop</code> operation removes an item from the "top" of the stack and returns it in one form or another.</p>
    <p>There are also other operations which are sometimes allowed, such as <code>peeking</code> at the top of the stack, which tells the "top" value on the stack without removing it.</p>
