    <h3>Similarity and Rules</h3>
        <p>French is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages">Romance Language</a> family, alongside Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and others.</p>
        <p>The Romance Languages stem from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgar_Latin">"vulgar"</a> - nonstandardized, dissimilar from classical - Latin.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 80%;">A sidenote is that "vulgar" stems from Latin <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vulgaris">"vulgaris"</a>, which describes the common people, next time you speak a vulgarity remind yourself of how "common" you are behaving.</p>
        <p>To return, I personally speak some French alongside Spanish. They share similar lingustic rules, having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject–object–verb">subject-object-verb</a> order.</p>
        <p>Similarly, their usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositive_adjective">Postpositive adjective</a> order rather than prepositive adjectives, as you may be familar with in English.</p>
        <p>Postpositive adjectives coming after the noun which they modify, in English this would be such as "A house blue", in Spanish "Un casa azul", in French "Un maison bleu".</p>
        <p>This is also reflected in their necessary need for adjective-noun agreement in both gender and plurality.</p>
