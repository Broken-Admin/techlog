    <p>You’ve likely used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals">Roman numerals</a> - I, II, III… - before and would be aware they’re a different style of writing numbers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals">Arabic numerals</a> - 1, 2, 3... - are what you’re likely used to using. But you may be interested to know about the different ways to write values.</p>
    <p>It is estimated that 20,000 years ago, during the time of the Upper Paleolithic period early quatanization began with tally marks. These marks later evolved into symbols which represent larger quantities as Roman numerals. Arabic numerals and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation">positional notation</a> were later developed.</p>
    <p>Positional notation is the use of powers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix#In_numeral_systems">radix</a> per each place moved, the earliest of these systems could be considered to be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_numerals">Myan numeral system</a>. You have likely been ingrained with the knowledge of the ones, tens, and hundreds places. These are all powers of the radix 10 in the base-10 system decimal, 10<sup>0</sup>, 10<sup>1</sup>, and 10<sup>2</sup>. This radix can be changed to allow for further base systems.</p>
    <p>Such as base-6 which uses 6<sup>0</sup>, 6<sup>1</sup>, and 6<sup>2</sup>. This could allow for 10 in base-6 to mean 12 in base-10. For simplification of understanding I will begin denoting their base with a subscript. Such as 125<sub>10</sub> denoting 125 in base-10.</p>
    <p class="small-text">A side note is that base-6 can be used to count on one’s hands, using your left hand as the 6ths place and your right hand as the 1s place. Allow for positional notation.</p>
    <p>Each number system of base-n will have n symbols to represent all values. Therefore base-6 would only need symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
    <p>In binary, base-2 only 2 digits can be used, base-9 only 9, base-11 has 11, and so on. This means that as the radix increases, the number of places necessary to represent a value decreases, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_economy">Radix economy</a> for in-depth mathematics upon this. For example, although 245<sub>10</sub> can be represented with 11110101<sub>2</sub> in binary’s base-two, only two places - F5<sub>16</sub> - are necessary to represent the value in hexadecimal’s base-16.</p>
    <p>A common use of binary is digital computer systems. Where a wire can represent a single position via an on or or off signal, a 0 or a 1. Other base systems which utilize the powers of 2 are commonly used to ease usage instead of having to read direct binary or spend time converting to decimal’s base-10.</p>
