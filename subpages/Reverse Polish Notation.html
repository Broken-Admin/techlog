    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish notation</a> is a way of writing algebraic expressions.</p>
    <p>It contrasts in comparison to the commonly used infix notation, which places the operators - such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, or <code>*</code> signs - between operands, reverse Polish notation has the operators placed after the operands.</p>
    <p>For example, the writing of the same equation can be compared, in infix notation <code>1 + 2</code> is written to convey the addition of 2 plus 1. In RPN - reverse Polish notation - this same expression could be written as <code>1 2 +</code></p>
    <p>This can be used to more easily express the stack <a href="./Data Structures.html">data structure</a>, in which numbers must be pushed - put on top of the stack - before the operation can be performed upon them.</p>
    <p>Such as <code>1 2 +</code> being interpreted as pushing 1, then 2, to the stack. Then popping - taking them off of the top of the stack - to perform the addition operation upon them, then pushing the result to the top of the stack.</p>
